1) chinelo signed up for the first time, but sqlalchemy paused the transaction...and then after auth, there was a localhost server error...why? can we recreate it? in any case, chinelo got recorded into the database with history
2) make sure songs are not full albums...do a time check on each video
3) tunesmash.herokuapp.com takes an unusually long time to load
4)  is not bound to a Session; attribute refresh operation cannot proceed
